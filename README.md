# Nomic

 Is a cross-platform **lightweight browser** aimed as a frontend for legacy *Web Applications* or to be used as a **Kiosk Browser**. It runs on **Windows, Linux and MacOS**.

# The Idea Behind

 The typical usage that got **Nomic** created was to be used as a **independent launcher for web applications** in such a way that the web application itself will be appear as a legacy **desktop application**, instead of a traditional web application opened on a typical browser. With **Nomic**, you can control what a user can do while using your application in a way that is not possible while using a browser.

 You can create several independent instances of **Nomic** each using different websites, in separated desktop windows, running as different O.S. processes, completely eliminating the usage of a browser.
