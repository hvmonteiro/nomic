# Nomic

Is a cross-platform **lightweight browser** aimed as a frontend for legacy *Web Applications* or to be used as a **Kiosk Browser**. It runs on **Windows, Linux and MacOS**.

# The Idea Behind

The typical usage aimed at creating **Nomic**, was to be used as a *independent launcher for web applications*, in such a way that the web application itself would be appear as a legacy *desktop application*, instead of a web application opened on a typical browser.

You can have several independent websites, using different browsing sessions, in separated desktop windows, running as different O.S. processes, completely eliminating the usage of a browser.

# Technologies Used
Nomic uses [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
